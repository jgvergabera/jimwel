            <p class="par">I’m Jimwel Vergabera, 20 years of age, currently residing at San Roque Dau II, Lubao, Pampanga.<br>
                 I have two siblings. Honestly, while I was in Senior high School, I was not sure yet what course I wanted to take.<br>
                 But there’s something that I really like to do and that is doing stuffs in the computer. 
                 And many say that IT is in demand these days so I took it eventually.
                 And now I’m in college taking up Bachelor of  Science in Information Technology.
                 My hobby of doing things in the computer has been a great way for me to introduce me to the technology world.
                 My own perception about BSIT is that it’s a combination of Programming, Multimedia, Networking, and Business.
                 But it is not easy taking up BSIT, I found it interesting but difficult because I’m not that intelligent.
                 Passing the exam is difficult if you did not study. Really. Some have failed, and I am not an exemption. 
                 But one thing for sure I want to finish my studies that’s why even though I’m having a hard time right now I will do my best to cope with it with the help of my parents and teachers.
                 I know that there’s no such thing as an easy course and if you really want whatever you’re doing or studying, no matter how hard it is, you’ll persevere to accomplish it.
